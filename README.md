Collection of simple 2D games I made in pygame.
Right now there are 7 games, I plan on adding more games or simulations in general in the future.
List of games ATM:

1. 2048: Number puzzle game that requires strategy and planning. Slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and reach the coveted 2048 tile
2. Minesweeper: Challenging puzzle game where you must uncover tiles on a grid without detonating hidden mines. You can customise the size of the grid
3. Space Invaders: Arcade-style game where you pilot a spaceship and shoot down aliens
4. Tic-Tac-Toe: Simple but strategic game where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3, 4x4 grid.
5. Breakout: Addictive brick-breaking game.
6. Snake: Nostalgic game where you control a snake that grows longer as it eats food. Game is customisable, you can change speed of the snake and the size of the board
7. Pong: Classic arcade game where players control paddles to bounce a ball back and forth.
